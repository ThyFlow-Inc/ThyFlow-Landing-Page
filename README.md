## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. 

[ThyFlow](https://www.thyflow.com) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do these challenges, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and (sometimes) JavaScript.**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. 

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
